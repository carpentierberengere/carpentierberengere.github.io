# What is it ?

This website is used as an online portfolio, to show potential employers and recruiters what I can do and who I am trhough my design and UI skills. 

This portfolio was made using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla Javascript.   

It might change in the future, and I might add new features as well, as I'm continuously learning new techs on my own and filling my portfolio with new projects and ideas.
